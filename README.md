# .nix

> Flakes for Nix systems.

<small>* Only get started to use Nix/NixOS from 2023/7/14, which means this is not stable, and mess</small>

<small>* For backgrounds, see [vollowx/.backgrounds](https://github.com/vollowx/.backgrounds)</small>

## Installation (not sure if it is useable for everyone)

```sh
# connect to network first
cd $USER_HOME # you maybe need to create the folder manually
nix-env -i git # temp install git
git clone https://github.com/vollowx/.nix
cd .nix
# change every vollow to $USERNAME, including file contents, filenames and folder-name
# change every sakura to $HOSTNAME, including file contents, filenames and folder-name
# replace /hosts/$HOSTNAME/hardware-configuration.nix with /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
# which needs to be generated by running nixos-generate-configuration --root /mnt if you are
# installing or nixos-generate-configuration if you already installed
./setup.sh $HOSTNAME
passwd $USERNAME
```

## Usage

**Rebuilding**

```sh
./rebuild.sh $HOSTNAME
```
